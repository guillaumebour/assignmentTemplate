# Assignment Template
A basic LaTeX template for assignments. More packages will be added when I will need them, but feel free to add yours and to make a PR.

## ToDo
- Limit ToC to section only if on the cover page
- Add options to have the following features:
     - The university name on the cover page
     - A logo on the cover page
     - Optionnal ToC
     - ToC on another page
- Add packages required for:
     - Algorithms (both pseudo code and langage sample)
     - Maths
     - Drawing (TikZ)
     - Tabular
     - References
